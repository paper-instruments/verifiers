"""proposer_solver: a proposer invents a verified math problem; n solvers race it.

The task-generation recipe env. The "proposer" seat plays the dataset (a topic
seed), uses its tools to CONSTRUCT and verify a hard integer-answer problem, and
ends with a JSON contract. The env mints a typed `SolveTask` from that trace and
fans it out to `--env.n` independent runs of the "solver" seat. Each solve is judged by the minted
task's own reward (exact final integer, against the proposer's verified answer);
the proposer is judged by what its problem DOES to the solvers — `learnability`
peaks when half of them crack it (4p(1-p), the automatic-curriculum signal) — plus
a `solve_rate` metric.

Seats are deliberately heterogeneous: point the proposer at a code-running harness
in a real sandbox and keep the solvers on a cheap tool-less chat loop —

    uv run eval proposer-solver-v1 -n 4 \
      --env.proposer.harness.id codex --env.proposer.runtime.type prime \
      --env.solver.harness.id null

Train-side, the seats flip independently per run (`--env.train_solver false`
trains only on proposer rollouts; both default trainable, late-bound to the run's
model). The flip is this env's own config — trainability is env truth, not a
per-agent knob.
