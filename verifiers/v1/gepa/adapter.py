"""The GEPA <-> v1 bridge: run a candidate system prompt over a batch of tasks and score it.

GEPA's adapter protocol (`evaluate`, `make_reflective_dataset`) is synchronous and
`gepa.api.optimize` blocks, but v1 rollouts are async. The runner manages one event loop by
hand: it enters `env.serving()` on that loop and runs the blocking `optimize()` on the main
thread, so each synchronous `evaluate()` drives its batch of rollouts with
`loop.run_until_complete` — the one sync↔async hop. (Mirrors how v0 vf-gepa bridged; no worker
thread, so a Ctrl-C unwinds straight through `optimize()` into the runner's teardown.)
