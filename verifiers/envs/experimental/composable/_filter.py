"""Helper for the base ``TaskSet.filter_fn`` kwarg.

``filter_fn`` accepts a Python expression string (typically a lambda) that
evaluates to a ``Callable[[dict], bool]`` and is used to filter the
taskset's dataset at construction time, after each concrete taskset's
``_process_example`` mapping. Predicates therefore see the
post-processed row shape (e.g. ``{"question", "info", "answer", ...}``).

Security note: the string is passed to ``eval()`` with a restricted
``__builtins__`` dict, but it is still ``eval()`` of user input. It is
intended for local ``vf-eval`` invocations, not for running untrusted
inputs.
