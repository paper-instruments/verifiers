"""The interception server: harness chat-completions, caught and proxied.

Every rollout runs an harness program whose OpenAI-style calls are caught here: a small
localhost server routes each `POST /v1/chat/completions` to our `Client`, records the turn
into the trace's message graph, and returns the result in OpenAI shape. We inject
`OPENAI_BASE_URL`/`OPENAI_API_KEY` so the program's SDK talks to us. Both non-streaming and
SSE requests are supported.

One server multiplexes many rollouts: each rollout registers a `RolloutSession` under its
own secret (the bearer token the harness already sends), and the server routes by that
secret to the right session. So N rollouts need one server (and, behind a remote runtime,
one tunnel) per pool member rather than one each — see `interception.pool`.

The server is a pure model boundary: one request, one turn — refusal checks (limits,
`@stop`s), the model call, the graph commit, retry atomicity. A run's user exchange
lives a layer up, between harness segments (see `verifiers.v1.rollout`); nothing
conversational happens here. Tools are handled out-of-band (run by the harness).
