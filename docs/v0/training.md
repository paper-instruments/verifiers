## Hosted Training

Hosted Training, available within our Lab platform, enables you to automatically train models via `prime-rl` without needing to manage your own infrastructure. Hosted Training supports LoRA for RL training, and can be used with any environment built with Verifiers.

### Configuration

Use the `prime lab setup` script to download example configuration files for Hosted Training into your workspace:

```bash
prime lab setup
```

This will download example TOML configs for Hosted Training into `configs/rl/`, example eval configs into `configs/eval/`, along with `configs/endpoints.toml` and GEPA starter configs in `configs/gepa/`:

```

Example configuration file for the `primeintellect/reverse-text` environment with `Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B`:

```toml
# Qwen3.5 dense models. Uncomment exactly one model.
# model = "Qwen/Qwen3.5-0.8B"
# model = "Qwen/Qwen3.5-2B"
model = "Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B"
# model = "Qwen/Qwen3.5-9B"

max_steps = 100
batch_size = 128
rollouts_per_example = 8

[sampling]
max_tokens = 1024

[[env]]
id = "primeintellect/reverse-text"
```

## Training with `prime-rl`

Our [`prime-rl`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl) trainer is a production-ready async RL training framework that supports large-scale multi-node training, agentic rollouts with Verifiers environments, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, LoRA adapters, and other training algorithms such as SFT and online distillation. We recommend using `prime-rl` for training with Verifiers environments on self-managed GPU infrastructure. The default configuration distills the best practices from our research team's experience and the broader community into a stable, easy-to-use recipe, including advanced features such as online difficulty filtering, continuous batching, in-flight weight updates, importance sampling and logprob clipping for stability, and more.

### Setup and Configuration

To set up your workspace for training with `prime-rl`, run:

```bash
prime lab setup --prime-rl
```

This will clone and install the `prime-rl` trainer and its dependencies. For configuration files and launch commands, use the [prime-rl documentation](https://docs.primeintellect.ai/prime-rl).

## Prompt Optimization with `prime gepa run`

`prime gepa run` is the CLI entrypoint for automatic system prompt optimization using [GEPA](https://github.com/gepa-ai/gepa) (Genetic-Pareto prompt optimization). It iteratively refines your environment's system prompt using a teacher LLM to reflect on evaluation results, without requiring gradient-based training. Current support is for system prompt optimization only.

### Usage

Basic usage mirrors `prime eval run`:

```bash
prime gepa run wiki-search --model google/gemini-3-flash-preview
```

This will optimize the system prompt for the `wiki-search` environment using the specified model for both evaluation rollouts and reflection. Results are saved to `environments/wiki-search/outputs/gepa/`.

Key options:

- `--model` / `-m`: Model for evaluation rollouts
- `--reflection-model` / `-M`: Teacher model for prompt reflection (defaults to `--model`)
- `--max-calls` / `-B`: Evaluation budget (default: 500)
- `--num-train` / `-n`: Training examples (default: 100)
- `--num-val` / `-N`: Validation examples (default: 50)
- `--minibatch-size`: Number of examples evaluated together per reflection step (default: 3)
- `--perfect-score`: Maximum score for a rollout in your environment (if applicable); minibatches achieving this score are skipped during reflection (useful if your environment has a known max score)
- `--state-columns`: Additional state columns to copy into the reflection dataset. By default, `query`, `completion`, `expected_answer`, `reward`, and `error` are included. Use this to add environment-specific state fields (e.g., `--state-columns tool_calls reasoning_trace`)

In TOML configs, set GEPA parameters such as `max_calls`, `num_train`, `num_val`, `minibatch_size`, and `max_concurrent` under `[gepa]`. Put generation parameters such as `max_tokens` and `temperature` under `[sampling]`; the CLI passes that table through as `sampling_args`. Use `[[env]]` for one or more environments; GEPA samples train and validation examples uniformly by environment. A single `[env]` table is still accepted for older configs.

### Output

After optimization, you'll find:

- `system_prompt.txt` - The optimized system prompt.
- `results.jsonl` - Candidate prompt rows for evaluation upload; GEPA-specific fields live under `info`.
- `pareto_frontier.jsonl` - Best candidate references per validation example
- `metadata.json` - Run configuration and summary

Use `prime eval run` to verify performance before and after optimization.

## RL Rules of Thumb

RL training can be sensitive to implementation details and hyperparameters. Some simple practical guidance:

### Before Training

1. **Evaluate baseline performance**: If your model gets 0% reward after 10+ attempts, the task is too hard
2. **Check task difficulty**: If baseline is already 80%+, consider harder examples
3. **Ensure reward diversity**: You want varied scores within each generation group

### Performance Trade-offs

**For more aggressive training** (higher risk of collapse):

- Increase learning rate (1e-5 to 1e-4 for LoRA, 1e-6 to 1e-5 for full finetuning)
- Decrease `rollouts_per_example` and `batch_size` for faster generation

**For more stable training** (slower progress):

- Increase `rollouts_per_example` (16-32)
- Increase `batch_size` (512-1024)
- Use larger models (14B+)

The best way to improve training is to ensure appropriate task difficulty for your model. When using Hosted Training or `prime-rl`, you can enable online difficulty filtering to ensure that rollout groups used for training always contain a diversity of rewards.

### Inference Client Types

The rollout client's `client_type` controls how prompt assembly and token state flow between the inference server and the trainer. For RL the trainer must see the exact tokens the server sampled — re-tokenization across turns drifts under BPE round-trip and fragments multi-turn rollouts into multiple training samples.

- **`openai_chat_completions`** (MITO, *messages-in*): standard OpenAI-compatible path. Server-side chat templating, returns text. The trainer re-tokenizes — fine for eval and short single-turn training, but can fragment multi-turn rollouts.
- **`openai_chat_completions_token`** (TITO, *token-in*): server-side templating, but returns prompt and completion token IDs alongside text so the trainer doesn't re-tokenize. Use when you trust the server's chat template to be stable across turns.
- **`renderer`**: client-side tokenization via a per-model renderer in the [`renderers` package](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers/tree/main/packages/renderers). The trainer renders messages to token IDs locally and sends those to vLLM's `/v1/generate` endpoint. The renderer's `bridge_to_next_turn` extends prior-turn tokens verbatim across multi-turn boundaries (the *extension property*) and synthesizes the canonical turn-close on mid-completion truncation, so multi-turn rollouts merge into one training sample with one clean loss mask.

For production RL training, use `openai_chat_completions_token` — it's the tried-and-tested path with broad model coverage. The `renderer` client is newer and offers stronger token-preservation guarantees in theory, but hand-coded renderers exist only for a subset of models, and corner cases are still being shaken out. See [reference § Built-in Clients](reference.md#built-in-client-implementations) for the full list.

### Common Issues

**Non-Increasing Chat Templates:** The Qwen3 and DeepSeek-R1 model series both remove `<think>` sections from messages when processing inputs, which violates the increasing context requirement for multi-turn training. We provide versions of many of these models with [modified chat templates](https://huggingface.co/collections/willcb/qwen3-68434f4883925bfdb4570ee5).

**OOM during generation:**

- Reduce `rollouts_per_example` or `micro_batch_size`
- Use LoRA instead of full finetuning
- Check vLLM server has sufficient memory

**Training instability:**

- Decrease learning rate
- Increase `rollouts_per_example`
- Increase `batch_size`

**Slow training:**

- Increase learning rate
- Leverage continuous rewards
- Use online difficulty filtering
- Calibrate difficulty appropriately via smarter models, easier tasks

## Other Trainers

`verifiers` is intended to be largely trainer-agnostic and is straightforward to support for any trainer which can expose an OpenAI-compatible inference client for rollouts.
