"""Persist an agent's final git patch into `trace.info` at finalize time.

SWE-style tasksets call `capture_patch` from `Task.finalize` — after the harness
finishes, while the runtime is live, before scoring mutates the repo (restoring
test files, switching commits) — so the diff is exactly what the agent produced,
including edits to test files (intentional: they reveal reward hacking).

The diff is taken against `base_commit` when the caller has one — a dataset row
field, or a SHA recorded with `resolve_head` at setup time and kept in host
memory (never the sandbox, where an agent could tamper with it) — so commits the
agent made are included. Bare `HEAD` is the fallback of last resort and misses
agent commits.
