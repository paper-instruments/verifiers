"""agentic-judge: a solver plays the task, a judge verifies it in the same box.

A reusable env (`--env.id agentic-judge` over any taskset): the box is
provisioned from the solver's runtime policy, the solver plays the task in it,
and a code-executing judge then inspects the work as the agent left it, with
the solver's full trace record uploaded at `/tmp/trace.json`. The judge grades
rubric criteria (`[env.task]`: policy prompt, criteria file) and writes its
verdicts to `/tmp/verdict.json`; `finalize()` validates them strictly onto the
solver's trace — `judge/<name>` metrics plus a weighted-mean `judge` reward,
composed with the taskset's own rewards via `[env.score]` (judge-only by
default).

selectively (list its keys, then slice out specific fields with python or jq)
and pull only what you need. It is complete — it may also carry the task's own
scores/metrics and reference material (a gold answer, a reference solution,
held-out tests). Those are context, not your standard: recorded scores can be
wrong and references can be narrower than the task; do not over-index on how a
