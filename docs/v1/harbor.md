# Harbor

verifiers offers built-in support for Harbor via the `HarborTaskset` class. Creating a Harbor-based taskset is straightforward in most cases:

```python
import verifiers.v1 as vf
from verifiers.v1.tasksets.harbor import HarborConfig, HarborTask, HarborTaskset


# Set the dataset to the same name as registered in the Harbor registry
class TerminalBench2Config(HarborConfig):
    dataset: str = "terminal-bench/terminal-bench-2"


# The data will get loaded automatically
class TerminalBench2Taskset(
    HarborTaskset, vf.Taskset[HarborTask, TerminalBench2Config]
):
    pass
```

You can also write custom code for your tasksets. A common customization is to set images for tasks that don’t come with one in their `task.toml`:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Literal

import verifiers.v1 as vf
from verifiers.v1.tasksets.harbor import HarborConfig, HarborTask, HarborTaskset

IMAGE_TEMPLATE = "registry.example.com/openthoughts/{task}:latest"


class OpenThoughtsTBLiteConfig(HarborConfig):
    dataset: Literal["openthoughts/openthoughts-tblite"] = (
        "openthoughts/openthoughts-tblite"
    )
    # Tell verifiers to use the pre-built image
    ignore_dockerfile: bool = True


class OpenThoughtsTBLiteTaskset(
    HarborTaskset, vf.Taskset[HarborTask, OpenThoughtsTBLiteConfig]
):
    def load(self) -> list[HarborTask]:
        # Use the public image instead to avoid building the image at runtime; the row
        # data is frozen, so rebuild each task around an updated copy.
        return [
            HarborTask(
                task.data.model_copy(
                    update={
                        "image": IMAGE_TEMPLATE.format(
                            task=Path(task.data.task_dir).name
                        )
                    }
                ),
                task.config,
            )
            for task in super().load()
        ]
```

To create and reuse images for your tasksets, build the Dockerfile with Docker and push it to a registry, then set the resulting image reference as the task's `image` field.

On the `prime` runtime any pullable image reference just works: the first sandbox to use an image makes the platform build and cache what it needs from it (for VM sandboxes this build can take ~10 minutes — the eval dashboard marks affected rollouts as `build` and a warning is logged); every later sandbox on the same reference starts in seconds.

## Additional features

By default, each task's declared agent and verifier timeouts are ignored (`ignore_timeouts = true`): Harbor task timeouts are authored against Harbor's own runtime, so enforcing them confounds model capability with the speed of your inference stack. Set `ignore_timeouts = false` (or pass `--no-env.taskset.ignore-timeouts`) to apply them, e.g. for a faithful comparison against the Harbor implementation.

With `ignore_timeouts = false`, every Harbor taskset can also be modified with a `timeout_multiplier`, and any Harbor taskset with a `resource_multiplier`:

```toml
[env.taskset]
id = "MY_TASKSET"
ignore_timeouts = false
timeout_multiplier = 2.0
resource_multiplier = 2.0
```

The `timeout_multiplier` multiplies both the agent and verifier timeout, while the `resource_multiplier` multiplies the task's CPU, memory and disk space. You might want to use these multipliers when the tasks set too tight limits and/or the agent is slow.

## Network policies

Harbor's effective agent network policy is applied to Docker or Prime VM harness
runtimes. An `[agent].network_mode` override takes precedence over the `[environment]`
baseline; legacy `[environment].allow_internet` is normalized by Harbor's schema.

| Harbor mode | Task network policy |
| --- | --- |
| `public` | Sets the task allowlist to `["*"]`, leaving the evaluator policy intact. |
| `no-network` | Sets the task allowlist to `[]` (framework routes only). |
| `allowlist` | Sets the task allowlist to `allowed_hosts`. |

Trusted task and harness setup remains online. The policy starts immediately before the
agent and stays active through finalization and scoring. Interception and MCP URLs are
added automatically in allowlist and framework-only modes. Concrete task/runtime
allowlists combine, as do blocklists; framework-only access on either side takes
precedence, and concrete allowlists cannot be combined with blocklists. Docker framework
routes take precedence over deny rules, while ordinary Prime deny rules are applied
unchanged and may block a matching route. Restricted Harbor tasks require Docker or a
Prime VM; Prime accepts host-level entries.

## Shortcomings

verifiers does not have parity with Harbor yet, so some features are missing and currently being worked on. The most notable missing features right now are:

- Switching to a different verifier-phase network policy ([Harbor Docs](https://www.harborframework.com/docs/tasks/network-policy))
- Shared & separate verifiers ([Harbor Docs](https://www.harborframework.com/docs/tasks#verifier-environment-shared-vs-separate))
- Multi-step tasks ([Harbor Docs](https://www.harborframework.com/docs/tasks/multi-step))
