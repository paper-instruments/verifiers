"""Resume an interrupted eval: reload its finished rollouts and run only the rest.

`--resume <dir>` reloads the run's saved config verbatim (so it takes no other
flags) and writes back into the same dir. `load` keeps the good saved rollouts and
re-runs what's owed: missing rollouts (never written) and errored ones (dropped and
redone).

A saved rollout is matched to a selected task by content: `task_key` hashes the
task's wire data. Tasks with identical data are interchangeable, a task whose data
changed since the interrupted run re-runs, and nothing depends on `data.idx`. The
legacy (v0) bridge still matches by row index (`key_of`).
