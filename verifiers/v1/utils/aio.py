    the cancellation. A bare `asyncio.shield` is not enough: on cancellation it re-raises
    immediately while the inner task runs on orphaned — and the loop's shutdown then
    cancels that orphan mid-await anyway. This keeps awaiting (absorbing repeated task
    cancellations) until `coro` finishes; the first CancelledError is re-raised after.
    If `coro` raises without a cancellation, the error propagates unchanged; with one,
    the cancellation wins and the error is chained under it (`from`), so it is never
    silently lost. A second Ctrl-C that raises KeyboardInterrupt out of the event loop
    itself is beyond any task-level shield — that path is the atexit backstop's job."""
