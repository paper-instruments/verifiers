"""The compacting harness: runs a context-rewrite loop as a uv script.

It carries `notes` across compactions and sends a fresh `[system, user]` each one — the
task on the first turn, then only the carried-over notes — so the prompt is rewritten
rather than appended, and every compaction is its own branch (the deliberate stress test
for branch detection). Within a compaction it can use MCP tools (gather, then summarize
into notes). Its uv script (deps: openai, mcp) is prepared during setup, then launched as
the harness program.
