"""Revert-agent-test-edits + re-apply-test_patch helper.

Mirrors the canonical SWE-bench pattern used by upstream's harness before
running the grading test command. See
https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-bench/blob/main/swebench/harness/test_spec/python.py#L405-L462
and ``swebench/harness/utils.py::get_modified_files`` /
``get_new_files`` for the reference implementation.

Why this exists: both :mod:`swe_lego` and :mod:`swe_rebench_v2` apply
``test_patch`` at ``setup()`` time so the agent can *read* the failing
tests from ``t=0``. Without a revert step at grading, an agent can weaken
the FAIL_TO_PASS assertions mid-rollout and still score reward=1. The
three-step dance in :func:`revert_and_reapply_test_patch` closes that
loophole by:

1. ``git checkout <base_commit> -- <path>`` for every file the
   ``test_patch`` *modifies* (i.e. the diff source is not ``/dev/null``)
   — wipes agent edits to those files. Uses ``base_commit`` (threaded
   in from the row) rather than ``HEAD``: if the agent ran
   ``git add && git commit`` mid-rollout, ``HEAD`` points at the agent's
   commit (potentially with weakened tests), and a ``git checkout HEAD``
   would restore the tampered version.
2. ``rm -f <path>`` for every file the ``test_patch`` *adds* (diff source
   ``/dev/null``) — wipes the agent's version so the re-apply doesn't
   conflict.
3. ``git apply`` the ``test_patch`` cleanly from the reverted state.

Agent *source* edits (their actual fix) survive — only test-file bits
get canonicalized.

Note on path parsing: this module handles the common unified-diff header
shapes produced by ``git diff`` / SWE-bench's dataset builders. Paths
containing literal whitespace / non-ASCII bytes can be quoted with
``"..."`` (see ``git config core.quotepath``) — we strip surrounding
double quotes conservatively but do not attempt to decode C-style
escapes. That's a known limitation; SWE-bench instance ``test_patch``
fields in practice do not contain such paths.
