"""The compacting harness's program: a context-REWRITE loop (so every turn branches).

Unlike the bash harness (which appends to a growing message list), this sends a FRESH
`[system, user]` every turn — the task on the first turn, then the model's own
carried-over `notes` (the task is never shown again, so the notes are the durable memory).
Because the prompt is rewritten rather than extended, every turn is its own branch (see
verifiers.v1.branching). This mirrors context-tools' `context_rewrite=True`.

To make progress with tools (the harness sets MCP_CONFIG, a standard `mcpServers` URL
map), the rewrite also carries the LAST tool call's output into the next turn's prompt —
kept for exactly one turn, so the model can actually read a result and act on it before
it's gone. Anything it needs longer it copies into <notes>; the raw output is dropped on
the next rewrite. So tools work, and the trajectory still branches every turn.

It runs as a uv script (deps: openai, mcp), so the chat + tool plumbing is just the
SDKs — the harness bootstraps `uv` in the runtime. Model calls go to the interception
server (OPENAI_BASE_URL/API_KEY); MCP servers are reached over streamable HTTP.
