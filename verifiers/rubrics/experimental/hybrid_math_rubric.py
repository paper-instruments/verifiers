As a grading expert, your task is to determine whether the candidate's final answer matches the provided standard answer. Follow these evaluation guidelines precisely:

Evaluation Protocol:
1. Reference Standard:
   - The standard answer is definitive and always correct
   - The question is perfectly valid - never question them
   - Do not regenerate answers; only compare with the given standard

2. Comparison Method:
   - Carefully analyze the question's requirements and the standard answer's structure
     * Determine whether the question expects exact matching of the entire standard answer or allows partial matching of its components.
     * This determination must be made based on the question's phrasing and the nature of the standard answer.
   - Compare ONLY the candidate's final answer (ignore all reasoning/explanation errors)
   - Disregard any differences in formatting or presentation style
   - For mathematical expressions: calculate step by step whether the two formulas are equivalent
   - For multiple-choice questions: compare only the final choice and corresponding option content

3. Multi-part Answers:
   - For questions requiring multiple responses (e.g., multi-select):
   - All parts must match the standard answer exactly.
   - Compare each sub-answer step by step. Partial matches are considered incorrect.

4. Validity Check:
   - Reject answers that are:
     * Incomplete (cut off mid-sentence in the final sentence, lacking a complete response) → Label as INCOMPLETE
     * Repetitive (repetition of words or phrases in a loop) → Label as REPETITIVE
     * Explicit refusals (e.g., directly return "I cannot answer/provide/access ...") → Label as REFUSAL
   - For invalid answers, specify the type in the judgment (e.g., \\boxed{{C}} - INCOMPLETE).

Grading Scale:
\\boxed{{A}} - CORRECT:
   - Answer matches standard exactly (including equivalent expressions)
   - For numerical answers: consider as equivalent if values match when rounded appropriately
   - Semantically equivalent responses

\\boxed{{B}} - INCORRECT:
   - Any deviation from standard answer
   - Partial matches for multi-part questions

\\boxed{{C}} - INCOMPLETE/REPETITIVE/REFUSAL:
   - Fails validity criteria above (must specify: INCOMPLETE/REPETITIVE/REFUSAL)

Execution Steps and Output Formats:

Analysis step by step: [
Thoroughly evaluate the candidate's answer including:
(1) First check if the answer is INCOMPLETE (cut off mid-sentence), REPETITIVE (looping repetition), or a REFUSAL (explicit denial) - if so, immediately classify as \\boxed{{C}} with the corresponding type.
(2) Analyze the question's core requirements and the standard answer's structure, for example:
- Strict requirements: Identify mandatory constraints (e.g., simplification, answer order, multi-part completeness)
- Tolerant allowances: Ignore non-critical deviations (e.g., missing option labels in MCQs, equivalent but unformatted expressions)
- Required answer type, precision level, etc.
(3) Perform a detailed comparison between the candidate's final answer and the standard answer, for example:
- Content equivalence
- Permitted variations in numerical precision
- Allowed expression formats]
Final Judgment: \\boxed{{A/B/C}} - <CORRECT/INCORRECT/INCOMPLETE/REPETITIVE/REFUSAL>

Here is your task.
