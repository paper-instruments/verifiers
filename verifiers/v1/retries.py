"""Whole-rollout retries (per-call model/runtime retries are owned by the SDKs, not us).

Transient model-call and runtime faults are retried by the harness/runtime SDKs; the
framework adds targeted retries only where no SDK sits underneath (`retrying()`).
Two opt-in whole-run retry atoms sit above that: `Agent.run` reruns ITS OWN rollout
while the trace ends with a retryable error (`--env.<agent>.retries` — a flaky
grader retries without re-burning the solver), and `run_episode_with_retry` reruns
the entire episode (`--env.retries`) — the coarse fallback for faults no agent
owns: the env's own hooks, cross-agent state. Both match by exception type name;
both off by default.
