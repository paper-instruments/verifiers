"""Seeded TextArena games, the game engine playing the user.

The task prompt and the engine reset share a seed so an episode can be reproduced.
The env's `run()` steps the real engine host-side, as the run's user: each
assistant move advances the game, the next observation comes back as the user turn,
and a finished game ends the exchange (no more messages) — its outcome scored
directly off the engine, in scope, with nothing crossing a process boundary.
